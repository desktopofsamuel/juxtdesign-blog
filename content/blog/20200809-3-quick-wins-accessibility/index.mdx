The first tip from [@juxt_design](https://instagram.com/juxtdesignco) is Accessibility ✌️ ! Accessibility matters because making your site accessible meaning even more people (more than 1 billion disabled people in the world 🧑‍🦯🧏🧑‍🦽) can easily access your site. It stands for diversity and inclusion for your company and there are guidelines for you to follow.

## Step 1: How to evaluate my site's accessibility?

Use Web.dev or WAVE to spot out the accessibility problems on your website. Little effort to your site can make your accessibility score up to 90+. You can also use Stark on Figma & Sketch when you are designing app interfaces.

## Step 2: Quick wins to make your site accessible

Add alt text to images on your website to make your images speak for themselves. You can also double-check your color contrast is accessible to visually impaired users. Keep in mind that your site should be properly organized in a hierarchy.

## Step 3: There is no step 3! Sit and wait for more traffics to come over time.

Have I mentioned accessible websites are easier found by search engines as well?
